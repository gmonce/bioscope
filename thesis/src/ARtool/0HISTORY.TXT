v1.1.2 - 02/04/2002 - made a small optimization in HashTree
                    - simplified code for AprioriRules

v1.1.1 - 01/17/2002 - cleaned-up ARtool interface code
                    - added Close button to GenDBDialog                    
                    - modified AR generation algorithms to set the
                      support of the antecedents and consequents of
                      the generated rules
                    - AssociationRule can now compute the value of
                      a rule according to a number of measures
                    - added Compute measure menu item to allow the
                      user to compute other measures than confidence

v1.0.0 - 01/12/2002 - First release of ARtool.
_____________________________________________________________________

History of ARtool up to first release:

2002 - I implemented the ARtool GUI and made some more changes to the
command line utilities and the laur.dm.ar and laur.tools Java
packages.

2001 - I revisited the sources from ARMiner, made some fixes and many
style changes, put core files in package laur.dm.ar, added
algorithms CoverRules and CoverRulesOpt, and created tools minedb,
gendb, diffcache, and dbtool.

2000-2001 - While maintaining ARMiner I have fixed several errors and
added the new algorithms ClosureOpt and FPgrowth, and the new tools
asc2db and db2asc.

2000 - For the ARMiner project I rewrote in Java the original C++
implementations of Apriori and Closure. While doing this I have also
performed an optimization of the Closure algorithm.

1999 - Together with my wife, Dana Cristofor, we implemented in C++
the algorithms Apriori and Closure.
