Probably the most often quoted paper on the subject of association
rules is the paper describing the <B>Apriori</B> algorithm:<P>

<B>[1]</B> <I>Fast Algorithms for Mining Association Rules in Large
Databases</I>, by Rakesh Agrawal and Ramakrishnan Srikant, published
in the Proceedings of the 20th International Conference on Very Large
Databases, 1994, pages 487-499.<P>

The technical report version of this paper contains more detailed
information about the algorithm implementations:<P>

<B>[1a]</B> <I>Fast Algorithms for Mining Association Rules</I>, by
Rakesh Agrawal and Ramakrishnan Srikant, IBM Almaden Research Center
Technical Report RJ9839, 1994.<P>

The <B>Closure</B> algorithm was introduced in:<P>

<B>[2]</B> <I>Galois Connections and Data Mining</I>, by Dana
Cristofor, Laurentiu Cristofor, and Dan A. Simovici, published in the
Journal of Universal Computer Science, vol. 6, no. 1, 2000, pages
60-73.<P>

The <B>FPgrowth</B> algorithm was introduced in:<P>

<B>[3]</B> <I>Mining Frequent Patterns without Candidate
Generation</I>, by Jiawei Han, Jian Pei and Yiwen Yin, published in
Proceedings of ACM-SIGMOD International Conference on Management of
Data, 2000, pages 1-12.<P>

The <B>CoverRules</B> algorithm comes from a recent article that is
currently available only as a technical report:<P>

<B>[4]</B> <I>Generating an informative cover for association
rules</I>, by Laurentiu Cristofor and Dan Simovici, UMass/Boston -
Computer Science Department Technical Report TR-02-01, 2002.<P>

For information on the various measures used to evaluate an
association rule, see:<P>

<B>[5]</B> <I>Mining the Most Interesting Rules</I>, by Roberto
Bayardo and Rakesh Agrawal, published in the Proceedings of the Fifth
ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data
Mining, 1999, pages 145-154.<P>
