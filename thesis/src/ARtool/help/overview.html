ARtool Overview
</H1>

<P>

ARtool is a free Java association rule mining application that is
distributed under the GNU General Public License. It consists of three
components:

<UL>
<LI>a set of Java packages:
<UL>
<LI><TT>laur.dm.ar</TT> - containing association rule mining
algorithms and data structures.

<LI><TT>laur.rand</TT> - containing a few classes for generating
random numbers or making random selections.

<LI><TT>laur.tools</TT> - containing various useful Java classes, not
all of them being used by ARtool.
</UL>

<LI>a set of command line utilities:
<UL>
<LI><TT>minedb</TT> - mines association rules on a specified database.

<LI><TT>gendb</TT> - generates a synthetic database.

<LI><TT>dbtool</TT> - provides several useful database functions:
checking integrity, displaying information, setting a new description,
etc.

<LI><TT>diffcache</TT> - compares the contents of two cache files.

<LI><TT>asc2db</TT> and <TT>db2asc</TT> - programs for converting a
database to an ASCII format and back.
</UL>

<LI>a Graphical User Interface built on top of the Java packages. This
provides a more intuitive interface for the mining process but there
are some functions that can only be performed by using the command
line tools.
</UL>

<P>

While I have tried to provide an easy to use interface, ARtool is not
a program targeted to the casual user. To use it you should already
know or want to learn more about association rules. These help pages
provide a quickstart, but for more information you should read the
papers mentioned in the <I>References</I> section, as well as looking
over the source code for ARtool.

<H3>What ARtool isn't:</H3>

<UL>
<LI>a mining application capable of extracting association rules from
any database - ARtool works only on binary databases stored in a
custom format.<P>

<LI>an application for the casual or commercial user - I wrote ARtool
for myself and for other people with an interest in researching
association rules algorithms. ARtool is more of an educational and
research tool than a practical data mining application.<P>
</UL>

<P>
